This project is a simple disease simulation, all settings are set in tools/attributes.py

before running the script, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

afterwards, configure simulation settings and execute script by using `python main.py`

Recommended settings for attributes.py for a first run are:

- population.populationSize : 1000

- individual.x_coord : range(0,100,1)

- individual.y_coord : range(0,100,1)

  

All other settings up to user discretion, the three settings above are the primary factors to simulation time required.
